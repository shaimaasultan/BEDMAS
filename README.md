# BEDMAS
How order of operations and approximation affects your calculations

A mathematical benchmark test to measure your calculations accuracy. this repo is to show you the importance of order of operations (BEDMAS)
and show by examples how your calculations results will be affected if your calculations are in the linit ranges for your machine data types.
and how same recurrent operations behave near machine data types limits.
